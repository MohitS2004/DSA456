## Part A: Questions about the Video

### 1. What sorting algorithm was the speaker trying to improve?

The small‑array fallback within std::sort (introsort with early stopping). He targets the small‑partition path (typically insertion sort) and proposes make_heap() + unguarded_insertion_sort(), together with tuning the threshold.

---

### 2. At what partition size does VS perform a simpler sort algorithm instead of continuing to partition?

Visual Studio switches at a threshold of 32 elements.
---

### 3. At what partition size does GNU perform a simpler sort algorithm instead of continuing to partition?

GNU libstdc++ uses a threshold of 16 elements. (He also notes Clang varies the threshold based on type traits.)

---

### 4. Regular insertion sort does a linear search backwards from end of array for correct spot to insert. According to the speaker, why does switching to a binary search not improve performance?

Although binary search reduces comparisons, its comparisons are maximally informative (~1 bit each) and thus unpredictable—leading to ~50% branch mispredictions and slower code on modern CPUs. A branchless version loses early stopping and must do all log2(n) steps, making it even slower.

---

### 5. Describe what is meant by branch prediction. (this may require further research)

Branch prediction is a CPU hardware mechanism that guesses the outcome of conditional branches to keep pipelines full. Correct predictions avoid stalls; mispredictions flush the pipeline and cost tens of cycles—so highly unpredictable branches (like in binary search) can dominate runtime.

### 6. What is meant by the term informational entropy? (this may require further research)

In information theory, entropy quantifies uncertainty—the average information (in bits) produced by a random variable. In binary search, each comparison yields about 1 bit (high entropy), which correlates with low branch predictability.

### 7. Speaker suggests the following algorithm:
- make_heap()
- unguarded_insertion_sort()

He suggests that by doing make_heap() first, you can do something called unguarded_insertion_sort(). Please explain what unguarded_insertion_sort() is and why it is faster than regular insertion sort. How does performing make_heap() allow you to do this?

unguarded_insertion_sort() is insertion sort without a bounds check in the inner loop because a sentinel guarantees termination. After make_heap(), the smallest element is at the beginning of the range, so while shifting larger elements left, the loop need not test for hitting begin()—the sentinel will stop it. This removes a branch (and often a compare) per insertion, improving the hot path. The heap also arranges many short, locally sorted runs, reducing moves and improving locality.

### 8. The speaker talks about incorporating your conditionals into your arithmetic. What does this mean? Provide an example from the video and explain how the conditional is avoided.

It means replacing if‑branches with arithmetic that uses a 0/1 value, avoiding jumps. Examples from the talk:
- Picking the “best child” in heapify without an if by computing index = right_child - (right_is_better ? 0 : 1), where the boolean becomes 0/1.
- Positioning from the middle with an odd‑size adjustment using arithmetic (e.g., add (size & 1)) instead of an if.
These reduce branch mispredictions and keep the hot path straight‑line.

---

### 9. The speaker talks about a bug in gnu's implementation. Describe the circumstances of this bug.

On rotated‑sorted inputs (a plausible real‑world pattern), libstdc++’s std::sort can degenerate into quicksort’s worst case (quadratic) instead of avoiding or recovering gracefully. He calls this a library bug; MSVC and Clang implementations avoid this pitfall.


---

### 10. The speaker shows several graphs about what happens as the threshold increases using his new algorithm. The metric of comparison is increased, and the metric of moves is increased, but time drops... What metric does the author think is missing? Describe the missing metric he speaks about in the video. What is the metric measuring?

He adds a cache/locality proxy D(n): the average distance between successive array accesses. A blended cost Time ≈ a·Comparisons + b·Moves + k·D(n) (with k ≈ 1/500 in the talk) tracks measured runtime. D(n) captures how far apart reads/writes are (cache friendliness), explaining why time can drop even when comparisons/moves increase.

---

### 11. What does the speaker mean by fast code is left-leaning?

Fast code stays close to the left margin: minimal nesting and branching, early exits/breaks, and straight‑line hot paths. The fewer indents/ifs/switches on the hot path, the more predictable and cache‑friendly the code tends to be.

---

### 12. What does the speaker mean by not mixing hot and cold code?

Separate frequently executed “hot” paths from rare “cold” fix‑ups. Exit early from the hot loop and handle uncommon cases afterward, so the hot code stays small, predictable, and I‑cache friendly.

## Part B: Reflection (Individual)

### 1. What did you/your team find most challenging to understand in the video?

I struggled most with why fewer comparisons didn’t necessarily mean faster code. The explanation around branch prediction, informational entropy, and especially the D(n) metric (average distance between successive array accesses) helped me connect CPU behavior and cache locality to real runtime. It was also challenging (but eye‑opening) to see how small implementation details—like removing a single bounds check via a sentinel, or folding conditionals into arithmetic—can matter more than big‑O comparisons for medium‑sized arrays.

---

### 2. What is the most surprising thing you learned that you did not know before?

The most surprising point was that binary‑search insertion can be slower than linear insertion due to branch mispredictions—and that a branchless version can still lose by giving up early stopping. I was also surprised that doing more work up front (make_heap) can make sorting faster overall by enabling unguarded insertion and improving locality. Finally, I didn’t expect that a plausible input like a rotated sorted array could trigger quadratic behavior in a widely used std::sort implementation.

---

### 3. Has the video given you ideas on how you can write better/faster code? If yes, explain what you plan to change when writing code in the future. If not, explain why not.

Yes. I plan to:
- Keep hot paths “left‑leaning”: fewer nested branches, early exits, and straight‑line code in tight loops.
- Replace predictable conditionals with arithmetic when it keeps the hot path branch‑free (e.g., use 0/1 booleans in index math).
- Use sentinels to remove bounds checks in inner loops when safe (unguarded variants).
- Measure performance with meaningful proxies, not just comparisons/moves—consider locality (D(n)) and branch predictability.
- Test across multiple data shapes (sorted, reverse, organ‑pipe, rotated, random, duplicates) and tune thresholds accordingly.

I’ll also be more open to “silly” experiments: if the machine’s behavior is complex, trying counterintuitive ideas (like heap + insertion) may uncover real wins.
